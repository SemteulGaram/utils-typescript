```
// Write In Progress
```

## 📝 Writing rules
- Write basic information at the top of all utility files
  - example
    ```
    /*
     * Example Util Module
     *
     * @version 1.0.0
     * @author Author
     */
    ```
- Keep backwards compatibility when updating utility files, or create a new version of the file or methods
- Keep the code as short and stable as possible
- Excluding dependencies as much as possible
